     // DEFINING FRAMERATE:
     // this specifies the framerate that will be set on the SpriteSheet. See framerate
     // for more information.
     framerate: 20,

     // DEFINING IMAGES:
     // list of images or image URIs to use. SpriteSheet can handle preloading.
     // the order dictates their index value for frame definition.
     images: [image1, "path/to/image2.png"],

     // DEFINING FRAMES:
        // the simple way to define frames, only requires frame size because frames are consecutive:
        // define frame width/height, and optionally the frame count and registration point x/y.
        // if count is omitted, it will be calculated automatically based on image dimensions.
        frames: {width:64, height:64, count:20, regX: 32, regY:64},

        // OR, the complex way that defines individual rects for frames.
        // The 5th value is the image index per the list defined in "images" (defaults to 0).
        frames: [
            // x, y, width, height, imageIndex, regX, regY
            [0,0,64,64,0,32,64],
            [64,0,96,64,0]
        ],

     // DEFINING ANIMATIONS:

        // simple animation definitions. Define a consecutive range of frames (begin to end inclusive).
        // optionally define a "next" animation to sequence to (or false to stop) and a playback "speed".
        animations: {
            // start, end, next, speed
            run: [0,8],
            jump: [9,12,"run",2]
        }

     // the complex approach which specifies every frame in the animation by index.
     animations: {
         run: {
             frames: [1,2,3,3,2,1]
         },

             frames: [1,4,5,6,1],
             next: "run",
             speed: 2
         },
         stand: { frames: [7] }
     }

        // the above two approaches can be combined, you can also use a single frame definition:
        animations: {
            run: [0,8,true,2],
            jump: {
                frames: [8,9,10,9,8],
                next: "run",
                speed: 2
            },
            stand: 7
        }
